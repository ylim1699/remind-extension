## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. First, clone this repository and download it into your computer and in the terminal, do npm i to install all the dependencies.
2. Go to chrome browser(only supported in chrome) and press the extension icon on the top right.
3. Then click manage extensions on the bottom of the popup page from extension icon.
4. On the top right, click the button that says Developer mode.
5. Next press load unpacked on the top left corner and select the dist folder of this project that you downloaded.
6. Now you can go to another tab and press the extensions icon and if you press the new my-extension icon, you will get the extension tab pop-up.
7. Anytime you need a reminder or need to write a note about something, you can now open up this tab, open it up, and add or delete them. 

Instructions for using the software:

1. Using this software is very simple because it's basically a todo app but in a web extention
2. I made it as a web extension because I never made todo app before because I didn't see a use for it. I thought it would be more efficient as a web browser that you can open and close in any tab.
3. Anytime you need a reminder or need to write a note about something, you can now open up this tab by clicking my-extesion icon.
4. Type in the input box and click add to open it up, and X to delete them. 

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* You need node, npm, vite, react, and typescript to create this app. 
* I'm not exactly sure what the sepcified version you need but it should work in the newest version.

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] I want to fix the UI/UX of this app first because it looks pretty plain. 
* [ ] I'm also thinking about adding a new feature of timer, so that you can set a time for things and it reminds you when the time runs out.
* [ ] I might also add a feature that allows the app to make your browser change color so that you can have a night-mode for any website (I'll have to see how realistic this is).
